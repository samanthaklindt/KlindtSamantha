(function(){

})();

var helloworld1 = function(){           //anonymous function

}

function helloworld2(){                 //name function

}

helloworld1();                          //calling anon function
helloworld2();                          //calling name function


//Both functions are called with the same code

//Have to know both functions, but pick the one you think is best as a student to use.
